        <h1>Turf and Proj JS Playground</h1>
        <p>Assignment: Take a look at both the Turf and the Proj4JS websites and identify 5 tools or functions from these libraries that you think might be useful in a future project and briefly describe this information.</p>
        
        <p><strong><a href="http://proj4js.org/" target="_blank">Proj4js <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></strong></p>
        <p><em>JavaScript library to transform coordinates from one coordinate system to another, including datum transformations.</em></p>
        
        <p><strong><a href="http://turfjs.org/" target="_blank">Turf.js <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></strong></p>
        <p><em>Advanced geospatial analysis for browsers and node</em></p>

        <h2>Five tools or functions from these libraries</h2>
        <dl class="features">

          <dt><a href="http://proj4js.org/" target="_blank">Proj4js</a></dt>
          <dd>I noticed with the mini project that there is a lot of data available on the web, but not all of it is in the format you need. This library could be immensely helpful in translating coordinates into the system you need, to help using some existing data files.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://turfjs.org/docs/#center" target="_blank">Turf.js center</a></dt>
          <dd>The center feature creates a point that is in the middle of many other points. I could see this helpful when visiting a new city, and plotting out points of interest. The center point could be an effective jumping off point. I could see this being useful in choosing a location for a hotel that is in the middle of everything you are interested in.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://turfjs.org/docs/#greatcircle" target="_blank">Turf.js greatcircle</a></dt>
          <dd>The greatcircle feature creates a curved line from one point to another. This reminds me of flight maps you see for various airlines. It creates the line in a more visually pleasing way than a straight line, as well as being a more accurate geodesic representation of the path. I would definitely use this in mapping a flight path.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://turfjs.org/docs/#linedistance" target="_blank">Turf.js linedistance</a></dt>
          <dd>The linedistance feature can be use to measure a line in the following units: degrees, radians, miles, or kilometers. This is helpful when mapping out a path, such as a running, hiking or biking, and determine distances. This would be really helpful to use in apps for personal health and exercise.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://turfjs.org/docs/#intersect" target="_blank">Turf.js intersect</a></dt>
          <dd>The intersect feature can be used to visually see where various areas overlap. I can see this being really helpful when using more than one set of data on a map. As an example, this is an area where gas stations are found, combined with an area where you can get a tire repaired. By visually seeing both, you can more easily choose a selected area.</dd>
